A computer worm is a form of software that can replicate and spread itself on a network, accessing other computers and devices connected to the infected host. Worms can be malware, often used by hackers to eat up bandwidth or manipulate files or programs on the system.A worm is different from a virus in that it does not require the host system in order to replicate. Like a parasitic worm, it can act independently. It can replicate and spread without the need for human intervention, such as a shared file.
Network operators can protect against worms by following risk management and security best practices. This includes having a robust firewall, using monitoring software to detect attacks as soon as they occur, keeping security software up to date, and educating users on cybersecurity.
